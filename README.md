# Banking Customer Discovery

## Description

This project involves segmenting customers given account spending patterns and past interactions with the bank. The workflow includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Imputing missing values, correcting data types and treating outliers, if necessary.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performing univariate and bivariate analyses, generating heatmaps.
3. **Scaling data**: Scaling the data to ensure better performance when applying PCA.
4. **Applying PCA**: Creating a separate dataframe for segmenting and profiling variables.
5. **K-Means/GMM/K-Medoids**: Fitting the K-Means/GMM/K-Medoids algorithm on PCA components.
6. **Evaluation**: Comparing clusters from different models.
8. **Business Recommendations**: Providing final business recommendations.
